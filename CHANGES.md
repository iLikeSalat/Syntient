## How to Proceed

1. Review the ROADMAP.md and FINDINGS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md files
2. Choose a specific task from Phase 1 to begin implementation
3. Follow the iterative development approach outlined in the roadmap
4. Provide feedback on the recommendations to refine the development plan

The most critical initial focus should be on implementing the continuous execution loop and beginning development of the web UI, as these components form the foundation for all subsequent enhancements.
