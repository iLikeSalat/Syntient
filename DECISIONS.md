# Syntient AI Assistant Platform - Technical Decisions

This document records key technical decisions made during the development of the Syntient AI Assistant Platform, including rationales and trade-offs considered.

## Architecture Decisions

### Modular Design
**Decision**: Implement a fully modular architecture with clear separation between core assistant, tools, and memory components.

**Rationale**: 
- Enables independent development and testing of components
- Facilitates future extensions and customizations
- Allows for component replacement without affecting the entire system
- Supports potential future commercialization as a SaaS platform

**Trade-offs**:
- Slightly increased initial development time
- Requires careful interface design to ensure components work together seamlessly

### Flask for API
**Decision**: Use Flask as the web framework for the API.

**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and minimal overhead
- Easy to set up and configure
- Extensive documentation and community support
- Suitable for both development and production environments

**Trade-offs**:
- Less built-in functionality compared to larger frameworks like Django
- May require additional libraries for advanced features

### Raw API Calls vs OpenAI SDK
**Decision**: Implement raw API calls to OpenAI instead of using the SDK.

**Rationale**:
- Avoids vendor lock-in
- Provides more control over request formatting and error handling
- Makes it easier to switch to different LLM providers in the future
- Aligns with the requirement for no lock-in to OpenAI SDK

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires more manual implementation of API interaction
- May miss convenience features provided by the SDK

### Optional LangChain Integration
**Decision**: Make LangChain optional for memory/tool orchestration.

**Rationale**:
- Provides a well-tested framework for certain AI assistant components
- Can accelerate development of complex features
- Maintains flexibility to use custom implementations

**Trade-offs**:
- Adds a dependency when used
- May introduce complexity in maintaining compatibility

## Implementation Decisions

### Environment Configuration
**Decision**: Use dotenv for configuration management.

**Rationale**:
- Simple and widely adopted solution
- Keeps sensitive information out of code
- Easy to configure for different environments
- Compatible with various deployment strategies

**Trade-offs**:
- Basic functionality compared to more advanced configuration systems
- Requires careful handling of the .env file in deployment

### Memory System
**Decision**: Start with a placeholder memory system with option to integrate Chroma.

**Rationale**:
- Allows for immediate development progress
- Provides a clear upgrade path
- Chroma offers vector storage capabilities important for semantic retrieval

**Trade-offs**:
- Initial implementation may have limited functionality
- Will require refactoring when upgrading to more sophisticated memory

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
**Decision**: Ensure code works on both Windows and Linux.

**Rationale**:
- Maximizes potential user base
- Supports development in various environments
- Aligns with specified requirements

**Trade-offs**:
- May require additional testing
- Some features might need platform-specific implementations

## Future Considerations

This section will be updated as development progresses and new decisions are made.
