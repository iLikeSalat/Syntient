# Implementation Notes for Syntient Real Tool Execution

## Overview
This document provides implementation details for the real tool execution functionality added to the Syntient project. The implementation enables two functional tools:

1. `browser_use` - Fetches and summarizes web content using requests and BeautifulSoup
2. `code_executor` - Safely executes Python code and returns the results

## Tool Implementation Details

### Browser Use Tool
- Located at: `/tools/browser_use.py`
- Functionality: Fetches web content using requests and parses it with BeautifulSoup
- Features:
  - Extracts main content from web pages
  - Supports CSS selectors for targeted extraction
  - Provides metadata (title, description)
  - Handles errors gracefully
  - Truncates long content for readability

### Code Executor Tool
- Located at: `/tools/code_executor.py`
- Functionality: Safely executes Python code in a restricted environment
- Features:
  - Security checks to prevent unsafe operations
  - Restricted access to potentially dangerous modules
  - Captures stdout and stderr
  - Returns execution results
  - Handles errors gracefully

## Tool Execution Format
Tools can be called using the following format in messages:

```
<<TOOL:tool_name {"param": "value"}>>
```

For example:
```
<<TOOL:browser_use {"url": "https://fcbsa.ch"}>>
<<TOOL:code_executor {"code": "print('Hello world')"}>>
```

## Integration with Assistant
The assistant is configured to:
1. Detect tool calls in the specified format
2. Execute the appropriate tool with the provided parameters
3. Inject the tool results back into the response

## Dependencies
The following dependencies have been added to `requirements.txt`:
- requests
- beautifulsoup4

## Testing
Test scripts are provided to verify tool functionality:
- `/test_browser_use.py` - Tests the browser_use tool
- `/test_code_executor.py` - Tests the code_executor tool

Run these scripts to confirm that the tools are working correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the application: `python run.py`
3. Use the tools via the UI or API by including tool calls in your messages

## Limitations
- The browser_use tool provides basic web scraping functionality but may not handle all websites correctly
- The code_executor tool has restricted access to Python modules for security reasons
