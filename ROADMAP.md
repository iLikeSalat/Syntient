## Implementation Strategy

The development will follow an iterative approach, with each phase building upon the previous one. Key considerations include:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Maintain the existing modular design to allow for easy extension and replacement of components.

2. **Continuous Integration**: Implement automated testing and deployment to ensure stability throughout development.

3. **User Feedback Loop**: Regularly gather feedback from users to guide feature prioritization and refinement.

4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for developers and users throughout the development process.

5. **Security First**: Prioritize security considerations at every stage of development.

By following this roadmap, Syntient will evolve into a powerful, autonomous AI agent platform capable of continuous coding and providing a stylish, user-friendly web interface for interaction.
